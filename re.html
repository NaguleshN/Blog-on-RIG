                    <h3>KCT's Platform for Research and Exploration</h3>
                    <h4> About us : </h4>

                    <p>Ré aims to cultivate and promote research and explorative culture among the student community at
                        KCT and through this inspire students around the world. KCT’s Platform for Research and
                        Exploration (Ré) is a start-up initiated and run by the students with the aim of instigating a
                        research culture among the student community. Ré offers technical expertise and financial
                        support to many student projects every year. Ré as a team strives to provide engineering
                        solutions to world problems by mentoring, guiding and incubating students’ research projects
                        targeted to solutions.</p>


                    <p>We, at Ré, work together to impart and enhance research culture in KCT. Our main aim is to bring
                        out and motivate students to take up research and to encourage the students interested in
                        research, to convert their ideas to reality. The projects proposed by the students will be
                        scrutinised by a review panel pertaining to the project. The selected projects will be funded
                        and carried out at Ré. These projects have to be framed in such a way that they can be completed
                        within the graduation period of the students. We will also guide students to obtain patents and
                        we will be providing them with good mentors, equipment and a better research environment.
                        Students who finish their research work under Ré will be assisted for publishing their work as
                        well. Ré calendar will provide students with innovative competitions and conferences happening
                        throughout India in which students can part take in, through Ré. This research wing of KCT will
                        provide a new platform for KCTians to seek knowledge and discover new things in science and
                        technology.
